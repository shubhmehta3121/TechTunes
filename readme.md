THIS RIGHT NOW IS PERFECTLY WORKING ON MY END AND THE ONLY ERROR IS THE 250MB SIZE LIMIT FOR DEPLOYING.

CREATING THIS SO THAT I CAN JUST COME BACK TO THIS COMMIT WHENEVER I MESS THINGS UP AND START FROM HERE.

SORT OF LIKE A CHECKPOINT.

THE CURRENT FILES ARE VERSION2-3 WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT.

MAJOR CHANGES MADE. MADE THE ONE BIG SERVERLESS FUCNTION INTO 3-4 MICROSERVICES. THE 250MB PROBLEM WENT AWAY. 

NEW ERROR IS THERE. WILL SEE THAT NOW

2ND CHECKPOINT.
