THIS RIGHT NOW IS PERFECTLY WORKING ON MY END AND THE ONLY ERROR IS THE 250MB SIZE LIMIT FOR DEPLOYING.

CREATING THIS SO THAT I CAN JUST COME BACK TO THIS COMMIT WHENEVER I MESS THINGS UP AND START FROM HERE.

SORT OF LIKE A CHECKPOINT.

THE CURRENT FILES ARE VERSION2-3 WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT.

MAJOR CHANGES MADE. MADE THE ONE BIG SERVERLESS FUCNTION INTO 3-4 MICROSERVICES. THE 250MB PROBLEM WENT AWAY. 

NEW ERROR IS THERE. WILL SEE THAT NOW

2ND CHECKPOINT.



25-12-2024 21.46pm

THE CURRENT FILES ARE VERSION 4. THIS VERSION IS DEPLOYING SUCCESSFULLY.
THE STATUS ON VERCEL SHOWS READY AND ACTIVE BUT STILL THE SITE SHOWS 404 NOT FOUND. 
NEED TO DEBUG THAT NOW. BUT THIS IS ANOTHER CHECKPOINT.
