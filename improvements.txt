Improvements and Optimizations To-Do:

1. Dependencies Optimization
   - Currently, some dependencies (like openai) are added to all microservices even though they're only used in specific services
   - Need to review and optimize requirements.txt for each microservice to include only the necessary dependencies
   - Specific cases to address:
     * openai package is only needed in assessment-api
     * Review other shared dependencies across services
   
   Benefits of optimization:
   - Reduced deployment package size
   - Faster cold starts
   - Better adherence to microservice architecture principles
   - Reduced complexity in each service
   
   Steps for future optimization:
   1. Audit each microservice's actual dependency usage
   2. Remove unused dependencies from each requirements.txt
   3. Test each service independently after optimization
   4. Ensure Vercel deployment settings are correctly configured for each service
   5. Document any shared dependencies that are actually needed across services
