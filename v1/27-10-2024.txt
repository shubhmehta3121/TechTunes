has anyone made the reading music notes project
understand ameb and look for ameb data specific
what is the easiest thing I can build to put a customer on it
outcoach has one big product, they will add product line outcoach ai for teachaers and students
get people signed up and paying for the product
point is having a fully workable solution
customized to our problem rather than generalized gpt online
if we have a working prototype, we can ask them for feedback
saving history of chat, using that to build profile
more and more customized to the customer
as far as possible from being generic
as specific you are, more the chance of being successful
it's all about speed
academics school side are easier to sell to parents
one stop solution
it should be a support platform

I need to think about - from an architecture perspective, how can I scale it
I start with claude or gpt, chain of thought and build a rag
Think from customer pov, what does matter to them

Start with music
go to ameb syllabus, ameb is certification for music teachers
see all the things, what is required to get the certifications

ping on slack with updates


people are trying to learn music theory
trying to create an ai platfrom

there are 3 levels
level 1 - most music theory is for piano / bulk is there for piano
problem number 1 - anyone trying to learn from any board, fundamentally curriculum should be same
ameb is very hated
first step is purely public knowledge
next layer is readint the music sheets
thrid level, preparing for a specific test, help me with that, then go to music certifications

clerk can be use for user management - no code to plug it in
ask them a bunch of questions - basically get their background / profile
next step -  give them sample questions to judge their level
What is the right answer and what is the wrong one
Ask their instrument in their profile

online resources are very small
practice questions are from previous years
LLM is to generate questions
LLM is to give feedback
LLM is to generate human input part

Store this in memory for each user
Complex part is keeping the appropriate context for the model to know each user
Preserve the knowledge as vector embeddings

 

cursor rules
cursor directory for rule giving


vercel for website sharing / deploying and share the preview link

frontend cursor
authentication clerk

for database - supabase
postgres in cloud
quick and easy to use

free for a long period of time

2 choices - see if I can deploy on vercel using cursor and supabase for storing the json data

v0 is best to give quick frontend. it is by vercel

share with people to see if this is correct.
Put 10 questions. Change from scracth button and remove it. Share the preview link.
