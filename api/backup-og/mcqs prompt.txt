You will create multiple choice questions based on specific topics for different instruments and grade levels. You will provide with questions, their options, the correct answer and the feedback for the correct answer. The feedback should be 2-3 sentences explaining why the correct answer is correct. Keep in mind that the options should all be sensible and not that the user has 4 options and only 1 obvious answer. Below I have provided you exemplars for you to learn and provide me answer in the same manner."

The thumb (1) plays on C and F, which are natural pivot points in the scale."

This crossing happens after the thumb plays F, allowing the hand to smoothly continue the ascending scale."

This pedal is commonly used for creating legato and expressive effects in music."

This creates a sharp, detached sound, as opposed to a smooth legato."

This includes markings like 'p' for piano (soft) and 'f' for forte (loud), and helps to convey emotion and contrast in music."

This articulation is often marked by a slur in the music."
